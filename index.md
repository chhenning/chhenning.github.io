## About

I’m a software and data engineer with 20+ years of experience building
scalable backends, data pipelines, and AI-powered applications. I work
across Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and modern data tooling to turn
messy, real-world data into reliable, usable products.

I enjoy designing systems end-to-end: ingestion and scraping, storage
and modeling, analytics and reporting, and LLM integrations.
