    <h1>Wellcare Premium Ultra (HMO) – Extracted Tables</h1>
    <p><strong>Extraction notes:</strong> Tables spanning multiple pages are consolidated where the structure remains
        consistent. In &#x27;Part D Prescription Drug Coverage&#x27;, the grid columns shift between 2-column text
        sections and 3-column cost-sharing grids; these are modeled within a single table using colspans. The top row of
        Page 7 is treated as a continuation of the &#x27;Diagnostic radiology services&#x27; category from Page 6.</p>

                        visit access to board certified doctors via Teladoc to help
                        address a wide variety of health concerns/questions.
                        Covered services include general medical, behavioral health,
                        dermatology, and more.
                        A virtual visit (also known as a telehealth consult) is a visit
                        with a doctor either over the phone or internet using a
                        smart phone, tablet, or a computer. Certain types of visits
                        may require internet and a camera-enabled device. For
                        more information, or to schedule an appointment, call
                        Teladoc at 1-800-835-2362 (TTY: 711) 24 hours a day, 7 days
                        a week.
                        What you should know:
                        The $0 copay above only applies when services are received
                        from Teladoc. If you receive telemedicine services from a
                        network provider and not the virtual visit vendor, you will
                        pay the cost shares listed for those providers, as outlined
                        within the Evidence of Coverage (e.g., if you receive
                        telehealth services from your PCP, you will pay the PCP cost
                        share).
